> **Forked from [nanxiaobei/ai-global](https://github.com/nanxiaobei/ai-global)**. Thanks to the original author for the open-source contribution.

### Differences from upstream

This fork defaults to system mode only and adds several features.

The original version switches between system/project mode based on which directory you run it from: `~` for system mode, anything else for project mode, creating an independent `.ai-global/` config under project directories. This version changes that to:

- No longer auto-switches mode by working directory — all commands default to global directory mode
- Keeps an explicit opt-in project mode: `-p` / `--project`
- Added `relink` command: rebuild all symlinks
- Added `clean` command: clean up orphaned backups
- Added `agents/` subdirectory support
- Uninstall preserves the `~/.ai-global/` directory (upstream deletes it)
- Uninstall asks for confirmation (Y/N) before proceeding
- Resource downloads include a confirmation dialog and source tracking (`source.md`)
- UI language is Traditional Chinese

When you need to manage AI configs per project, add `-p` / `--project` to the supported commands.

**Unified Configuration Manager for AI Coding Tools.**

Edit one file, sync to all your AI tools.

## Installation

### curl (Recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lazyjerry/ai-global/main/install.sh | bash
```

### npm

```bash
npm install -g ai-global
# or
pnpm add -g ai-global
# or
yarn global add ai-global
# or
bun add -g ai-global
```
---

## Usage

### First run

```bash
ai-global
```

Running without arguments opens an interactive menu where you can pick common operations for global mode or project mode.

To directly run the original scan, merge, and symlink update, use:

```bash
ai-global update
```

This will:

1. Scan for installed AI tools
2. Backup original configs to `.ai-global/backups/`
3. Merge AGENTS.md/skills/agents/rules/commands from detected tools
4. Create symlinks from each tool's config to shared directories

Note: AI Global only handles tool directories that already exist. It does not create directories like `.github` or `.kiro` for you.

### Project mode

`-p` / `--project` only supports the `update`, `list`, `list-*`, `relink`, `unlink`, and `add-*` commands. When used, it first confirms the current directory is not your home directory, then asks whether to treat the current directory as a project directory.

```bash
ai-global -p list
ai-global -p update
ai-global --project list-skills
ai-global -p relink
ai-global -p unlink codex
ai-global -p add-skill <user/repo>
```

Project mode uses the `.ai-global/` under the current directory and does not affect `~/.ai-global/`.

Project mode has its own tool directory mapping to avoid applying the global config directories directly. Main differences:

| Tool | Project mode location |
| ---- | --------------------- |
| Claude Code | `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/agents/` |
| Codex Skills | `.agents/skills/` |
| Copilot CLI | `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/instructions/`, `.github/prompts/` |
| Antigravity CLI | `.gemini/GEMINI.md`, `.gemini/.agents/rules/` |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/AGENTS.md`, `.opencode/commands/`, `.opencode/skills/`, `.opencode/agents/` |

### Add resources

```bash
ai-global add-skill <user/repo>       # Add skills
ai-global add-rule <user/repo>        # Add rules
ai-global add-command <user/repo>     # Add commands
ai-global update-skills               # Reinstall all skills from the install records
ai-global remove-skill <user/repo>    # Remove every skill installed from that repo
ai-global render-skills               # Rebuild the skills projection
ai-global disable <name|category>     # Disable a skill or a whole category
ai-global enable <name|category>      # Re-enable a skill or a whole category
ai-global list-skills                 # List skills
ai-global list-rules                  # List rules
ai-global list-commands               # List commands
ai-global list-agents                 # List agents
```

`add-*` records the source in `.ai-global/source.md` (format: `GitHub URL|type|install path`). `update-skills` re-clones from those records and overwrites the existing skills. It also syncs with the source repository: skills the repository added later are listed and installed on confirmation (default Y), and skills it removed or renamed are listed and deleted locally on confirmation (default Y). Nothing is treated as removed when the clone fails or no skill is found in the repository. To drop a skill you don't want, use `disable` rather than deleting its directory — otherwise it shows up as newly added on the next run. The old records are backed up to `source.md.bak` first. Locally authored skills that never went through `add-skill` have no record and are left alone.

`remove-skill` mirrors `add-skill` and works **per repository**: give it `user/repo` or a full GitHub URL and it deletes every skill under `v-skills/<owner>/<repo>/`, their projection symlinks, all install records from that source, and any matching disable rules. Skills from one repository often call each other (handoff hands off to implement, research feeds to-spec), so removing them one at a time would leave a half-set that no longer works. There is therefore **no command to remove a single skill** — to stop using one, `disable` it; the payload and the install record stay put and `enable` brings it back.

The full list of what will be deleted, along with the install source, is printed for confirmation first. Because each tool's skills directory is a symlink to the whole directory, the removal takes effect everywhere at once. **Removal cannot be undone — skills are not covered by the backup mechanism.**

Skills placed by hand under `v-skills/manual/` have no repository to name, so `remove-skill` will not touch them; delete the directory yourself and run `render-skills`.

Supports `user/repo` or `https://github.com/user/repo` format. Resources will be downloaded to the corresponding subdirectory under `.ai-global/`.

Short aliases are also available: `-ls`, `-lr`, `-lc`, `-la`.

```

### Skill categories (v-skills)

Every AI tool scans only the **first level** of its skills directory — none of them support category subfolders. So AI Global keeps the actual skill directories under `v-skills/` with nested categories, and projects them as a flat set of symlinks for the tools to read.

- **The install path comes from the source**: `v-skills/<owner>/<repo>/<source-bucket>/<skill>/`; manually added skills go to `manual/`. **There is no command to change a skill's category** — deriving the path entirely from the source keeps it predictable and reproducible, and keeps `update-skills` pointing at the right place. To rearrange, move the directory under `v-skills/` yourself and run `render-skills`
- **Edit the copy under `v-skills/`** — everything in `skills/` is a symlink
- **Skills with the same name can coexist in different categories, but only one may be enabled**; disable the rest
- A skill dropped into `v-skills/<any-category>/` by hand shows up after `render-skills`, no install record needed
- `update-skills` adopts any skill still sitting directly under `skills/` into `v-skills/` (it prints the full mapping and asks first)

`disable-skills.md` holds one v-skills relative path per line; a trailing `/` disables the whole category:

```
# Disable a whole category
lazyjerry/mattpocock-skills/in-progress/

# Disable one skill
anthropics/skills/pdf
```

Disabling only affects the projection layer — the payload directory and the install record are left untouched, so `enable` always brings a skill back. `disable` / `enable` also take a category path (`user/repo` or `user/repo/bucket`) to switch a whole group at once. This is the counterpart to `remove-skill` being repo-scoped: to stop using one skill, disable it rather than deleting it.

### Merge behavior

When you run `ai-global`, it merges items from all tools by filename:

- Codex has skills: `react/`, `typescript/`
- Claude has skills: `typescript/`, `python/`
- Result: `react/`, `typescript/`, `python/`

**Last file wins** (later tools overwrite earlier tools with same filename).

## Uninstall

```bash
ai-global uninstall
```

This will:

1. Restore all tools to their original configuration
2. Remove the `ai-global` command

Note: The `~/.ai-global/` directory is preserved — your config files remain intact. Remove it manually if needed.

If installed via npm:

```bash
npm uninstall -g ai-global
```
